    "# Spectrogram Generation with Gstreamer and Torch Audio\n",
    "\n",
    "It's been nearly a year since I last posted a project. So much has happened in the world of AI and machine learning, and I've been absolutely consumed with learning and experimenting with these new technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I've been working on processing high frequency audio data. This high frequency data, taken from underwater hydrophones, is specialized to capture frequency beyond the range of human hearing. Specifically, marine mammals like dolphins and porpoises use these high frequency sounds for echolocation and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal audio models like Wav2Vec2 are not designed to handle these high frequency sounds: they are trained on human speech recordings encoded at 16kHz. To effectively process these high frequency sounds, and get a model to actually understand them, we could turn to generating spectrograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectrograms are visual representations of audio signals. They allow us to visualize how frequencies change even if it is beyond human hearing. Using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the frequency is encoded in the y-axis, time in the x-axis, and amplitude is represented by color intensity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a single spectrogram image actually contains temporal information. Considering it is a static image, we can use it to train classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and analyze these high frequency sounds. We could also utilize CNN's in combination with LSTMs to capture both spatial and temporal features from the spectrograms. Or, we could even use transformer architectures to capture long-range dependencies in the spectrogram data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these approaches are really cool, but what if we have a live audio stream? Wouldn't it be cool if we could generate a live stream (both audio and video) that shows the spectrogram in real-time as the audio is being captured? Would this help computer vision models have an easier time classifying the audio data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, just sometimes, we have to do a little bit of classical software engineering to make things happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Source\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a really cool project called OrcaSound that captures live audio from hydrophones placed in the ocean. They have a live stream that you can listen to [here](https://live.orcasound.net/listen/orcasound-lab). Go check it out, seriously, it's super cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "![OrcaSound Locations](./orcasound.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, they actually have a short talk about the project and the machine learning they have already done with the data [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0vmU_Jf3f4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a little kid playing in the browser, I inspected the network traffic and found the actual HLS playlist URL. I can then inspect this with `ffprobe` to see the audio format."

    "oohhhh so cool. Now we are cooking! After inspecting the output of `ffprobe`, I can see that the audio stream is encoded as AAC with a sample rate of 48kHz and 2 channels (stereo). AAC is a really awesome lossy audio codec, built into the ffmpeg library, that provides good quality audio, at low bitrates, but with high frequency ranges! This is critical for capturing the range of frequencies used by marine mammals in their vocalizations. As stated before, normal human speech models are not designed to handle these high frequency sounds, so having a codec that can preserve these frequencies is essential for effective analysis and classification of the audio data.\n",

And with bindings in Python (and Rust my new favorite language), it makes it super easy to build complex multimedia pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we essentially need to do is build a live streaming pipeline that captures the audio from the HLS stream, decodes it, and allows use to capture the audio samples in Python, generating spectrograms at a fixed interval, and then encoding the spectrogram images into a video stream that can be outputted somewhere! That somewhere could be some kind of MP4 file, RTSP stream, or even a local display window. For now, we will output to a video file so I can embed that into this notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this in the command line, indeed, we do hear the live audio stream from the OrcaSound hydrophone! Success! Now let's start scripting this in Python so we can capture the audio samples and generate spectrograms. I've added comments to the code to explain what each part does."

    "Now I couldn't get this to run in a notebook unfortunately. But that's okay. The output was a little something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "caps: audio/x-raw, format=(string)F32LE, layout=(string)interleaved, rate=(int)48000, channels=(int)1\n",
    "tensor: (3200,) float32 -0.009153034538030624 0.008057080209255219\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few very important notes on the gstreamer application so far. For starters, we need to understand the caps information a bit more. The caps tell us that the audio format is `F32LE`, which means 32-bit floating point little-endian. This is great because it means we can directly convert the audio samples into a numpy array of float32 values. But the caps also tell us that the original data stream was non-interleaved stereo audio (2 channels). I'm not exactly sure why the hydrophone would be in stereo, unless it's simply to give the listener a sense of spatial audio. For now, I'm assuming we can work with a single channel (mono) audio stream for spectrogram generation. We added in the `deinterleave` element to the gstreamer pipeline to only capture a single channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important note is the shape of the tensor. `souphttpsrc` and `hlsdemux` are streaming the audio data in chunks. Each chunk will be determined by the internal buffering of the gstreamer elements but this doesn't nessesarily coorespond with the resulting video framerate we want to use in the resulting video. This is where we introduce the `audiobuffersplit` element. This will chunk up the buffers into fixed sizes that we can set to a given framerate. At the setting `1/15`, this will result in 15 frames per second in the resulting video.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have a live audio stream being captured in Python as numpy arrays of float32 audio samples at a fixed interval. Now, we can start to generate the spectograms. Generating the spectrograms though is going to be a bit tricky. A few things we need to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample rate of the audio stream is 48kHz. This means that we need to set the FFT parameters accordingly to capture enough resolution to see the high frequency sounds.\n",
    "- The length of the audio samples captured in each chunk will determine the time resolution of the spectrogram. If we want to capture more temporal detail, we need a way to buffer the spectogram images over time.\n",
    "- We need to convert the spectrogram into a format that can be encoded into a video stream. This means normalizing the data and converting it into an 8-bit image format.\n",
    "- We need to consider the color mapping of the spectrogram. Typically, spectrograms are visualized using a colormap that maps amplitude values to colors. For simplicity, we can start with a grayscale representation where higher amplitudes are lighter and lower amplitudes are darker.\n",
    "- For a standardized output, we should resize the spectrogram image to some standard resolution, like 640x480 pixels. But to maintain the aspect ratio to avoid distortion, we need to resize it properly and then crop it or pad it to fit the desired dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these things considered, here is a bit of code to achieve this:\n",
