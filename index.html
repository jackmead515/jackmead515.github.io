                <p>
                    I am a data scientist and engineer with a passion for my work. Growing up in Iowa,
                    surrounded by corn fields and gardening with my family, I developed a love for
                    agriculture and the environment. My entire career, I've been focusing on applying
                    my skills to wrangle data together for agronomists, environmentalists, research
                    scientists, and farmers whether on the land or in the sea. In my career, it's estimated 
                    that I've helped to automated the collection of nearly <b>~1,000,000,000</b> images and certainly
                    nearly a <b>pedabyte</b> of telemetry from sensors. (but who's counting). <img src="images/camera.gif" width="16" height="16"/>

                    <p>
                        For agronomists, I automated timelapse imagery
                        for research scientists to phenotype different species of corn. The biggest
                        challenges were dealing with the extreme temperatures, humidity, lack of
                        stable electricity, mischievous research scientists, and the limited
                        resources of a Raspberry Pi. <img src="images/plant.gif" width="16" height="16"/>

                        For fish farmers, I've automated the collection of video
                        footage to monitor the growth and behavior of fish. In the open ocean,
                        there is so much variability in the environment that it's difficult to
                        even keep the cameras online. One of the biggest challenges was collaboration
                        with a global team to ensure data collection. <img src="images/fish.gif" width="16" height="16"/>

                    <p>
                        For coffee farmers, I'm collecting images to monitor the growth 
                        of their crops to predict yield, disease, and pests. The most fun
                        part of this project is the volunteering aspect. I get to be in charge
                        of the project and take ownership of the data collection and analysis.
                        But the most challenging part is the amount of manual data collection
                        that is required. <img src="images/coffee.gif" width="16" height="16"/>

                    Over time, I hope to continue to learn and grow as a data scientist 
                    applying my skills to industries and communities in need. The environment
                    will always remain a passion of mine and whether or not I'm working in
                    the field, I will always be working to protect it. If your organization
                    is in need of a data scientist or engineer looking to make a difference,

                    I work on many different projects in my free time. Applying computer vision
                    and AI to coffee plants, scuba diving footage, custom game engines, and other

                        <p>
                            For the IBM Classification ML course, I decided to build my own
                            dataset for the Kona Coffee project I am working on. Although it's a
                            small dataset, it may reveal some interesting insights into what I
                            will deal with in the future.

                            As a volunteer research project, I decided to see if I could utilize
                            my skillset as a data scientist and apply it to an industry in need.
                            This is an introduction to the project and the data that will be collected.
